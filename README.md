# turbotrix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maclover7/turbotrix.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/maclover7/turbotrix)

Want to include Basecamp's awesome [Trix WYSIWYG
editor](http://trix-editor.org) in your Ruby on Rails application?
You've come to the right place!

Please see the appropriate guide for your environment of choice:

* [Ruby on Rails](#a-ruby-on-rails).

### a. Ruby on Rails

`trix` is easy to drop into Rails with the asset pipeline.

In your Gemfile you need to add the `trix` gem.

```ruby
gem 'turbotrix'
```

`bundle install` and restart your server to make the files available through the pipeline.

Import Trix styles in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

```css
*= require trix
```

Require Trix Javascript magic in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

```js
//= require turbotrix
```

Finally, any place where you would like to use the Trix editor in your
forms, just use the `trix_editor` helper:

```ruby
f.trix_editor :body
```

If you are using the [Formtastic](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic) gem or the [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) gem, you can do this:

```ruby
f.input :body, as: :trix_editor
```
