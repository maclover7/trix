# Trix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maclover7/trix.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/maclover7/trix)

Want to include Basecamp's awesome [Trix WYSIWYG
editor](http://trix-editor.org) in your Ruby on Rails application?
You've come to the right place!

Please see the appropriate guide for your environment of choice:

* [Ruby on Rails](#a-ruby-on-rails).

### a. Ruby on Rails

`trix` is easy to drop into Rails with the asset pipeline.

In your Gemfile you need to add the `trix` gem.

```ruby
gem 'trix'
```

`bundle install` and restart your server to make the files available through the pipeline.

Import Trix styles in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

```css
*= require trix
```

Require Trix Javascript magic in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

```js
//= require trix
```

Any place where you would like to use the Trix editor in your
forms, just use the `trix_editor` helper:

```ruby
f.trix_editor :body
```

Or if you are using the [formtastic](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic) gem:

```ruby
f.input :body, as: :trix_editor
```


Finally, when you want to display the contents of your form element:


```ruby
@post.fancyText.html_safe
```

or something more secure:

```ruby
sanitize @post.fancyText, tags: %w(strong em p br div ul ol li)
```
